These are some notes on running Goodman Games's Castle Whiterock megadungeon
adventure (written for D&D 3.5) using GUPRS Dungeon Fantasy or Dungeon Fantasy
RPG.

You can buy the Castle Whiterock PDF on DriveThruRPG:

The cheapest way to acquire enough GURPS to run this is to get the
Dungeon Fantasy RPG PDF from Warehouse 23:

Sorry, the Roll20 assets are not available.  Too hard to separate out other
