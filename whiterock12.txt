Note on desk: Assassination Options
Description of Party, and order in which they should be killed:
1. Seep, female elf wizard, many spells, can Teleport or at least Blink,
   can Mass Daze, often invisible, can cast without words or gestures,
   kill as fast as possible, do not try to take prisoner, do not bunch up
   and get Mass Dazed.
2. Eliash, Heavily armored elf cleric with flail, very strong, sources
   differ on combat ability: some say he's lethal and others say he's only
   mediocre, so possibly it depends on sanctity.  Try to fight in
   low-sanctity zone for his evil surfacer religion.  Be sure to kill him
   so he doesn't Resurrect his allies.
3. Zabar, human male thief, usually invisible, can See Invisible, flanks
   and stabs eyes.  Seems fairly weak, but Stone Giants tell us that he is
   the leader, so he may be intelligent or have secret magic or clerical
   powers.  Kill him as fast as possible.
4. Polly, female elf with powerful magic bow and Dark Vision googles, likes
   to flank and shoot in the back.  Use Missile Shield to stop her bow, and
   then deal with as you wish.
5. Gor-Ath, very strong orc with two handed sword, magic resistance, seems
   to be bodyguard slave, not sure if loyal or charmed.  May take alive
   if all the elves and humans are dead; he might be useful.
6  Wolfrik, duergar warrior traitor, possibly charmed, take alive if possible
   for interrogation.
Reward: $50000 for each elf and human, dead only, heads needed for verification.
   $10000 dead or $20000 alive for Gor-Ath and Wolfrik.  You can also keep all
   their gear; Polly's magic bow and Eliash's armor look quite valuable, and
   Polly stole Dark Vision googles from one of our human hirelings.
