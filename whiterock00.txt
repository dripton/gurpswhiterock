You are hanging out in the Inn of the Slumbering Drake in Cillamar, in the
afternoon before the place fills up, sitting near a warm fire, drinking some
moderately priced drinks, listening to a reasonably competent half-elven
singer, and hoping some kind of potentially profitable adventure turns up
before you need to downgrade to a less pleasant tavern.

Suddenly, in barges Quintus the old alchemist/wizard, followed by a big black
cat.  "Is there a druid in the house?" Quintus asks, far too loudly.  "I need
someone who can talk to animals.  It's important!"

The mood ruined, Brie stops strumming and asks "What's the problem, Quintus?
Cat hide your healing potion recipe?  And why couldn't it wait until the end of
the song?"

Ixnay the shoulder dragon, who was comfortably sleeping on some pillows in
front of the fire, opens one eye, looks over toward the door, and hisses at the
cat.

Both Quintus and the cat give the bard synchronized death stares, and Quintus
says "No, you fool.  It cannot.  My apprentice Lyssa is missing.  This is her
familiar, Dodger.  He's made it abundantly clear to me that she's in deep
trouble somewhere to the east and needs help.  If I were thirty years younger
I'd just follow the cat to the trouble, blast the everliving snot out of it,
and then make Lyssa collect the snot and turn it into a potion.  But I'm older
and wiser and slower than I used to be, so instead I'd like to find someone who
can talk to this cat and find out exactly what's up with Lyssa.  And then,
armed with the information in this feline's head, maybe we can find someone to
blast the everliving snot out of it for me.  And then bring Lyssa, Dodger, and
the snot back to my tower, unharmed."

Quintus pulls a silver coin out of his pouch and throws it at (rather than to)
the bard.  She catches it deftly.  "Sorry for interrupting your ditty; please
buy yourself a drink to soothe your tired throat.  Now, can anyone in this
place talk to a cat?  Or do you know someone who can, nearby?  Time is of the
essence."

Dodger hops onto a nearby table, and says "Meow meow meow hiss mrooow meow."

Ixnay hisses at Dodger again.
Dodger hisses at Ixnay again.

Arien, town drunkard: "Kidnapped, probably the same slavers who took me.  They
are horrible.  Probably sold her to the orcs who are going to work her to
death.  You have to save her so she doesn't suffer like I did."

Lord Granger Flitwick: "Yes, listen to Arien, he's totally reliable, not
anywhere near as drunk as he appears, and will totally help you rather than
just milk you for drinks."

Gnarkle: "Seriously, Quintus, you're taking orders from a cat now?"

Brie: "Rufus can probably speak to animals.  He lives about a mile to the
northwest, in an oak grove on the heath, but I don't know if he's home."

(Quintus has Seeker-16, -5 for nothing closely associated, -2 for range, +1
for knowing Rufus.  If someone remembers Rufus created the Food Chain game,
they can use the dice to fix the -5.)

Stableboys: Ulan (13) and Waldu (15, limps)

Serving ladies: Cyna (short), Joyce (eye patch), Golda (smiles), Suse (pocks)
