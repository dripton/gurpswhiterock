Ant Entrance: In their day, the Monks of the Dawning Sun had hidden paths
throughout the mountain, one of which led to a repository of knowledge, the
Halls of Forgotten Lore. Although those secret roads are long destroyed by the
upheavals of Castle Whiterock's turbulent history, the burrowing stonebore ants
inadvertently uncovered the entrance to the monk's library. In the northwest
corner of the ant queen's lair is a larva-filled, short tunnel that appears to
lead nowhere. A Search+0 check of the floor at the tunnel terminus will
find a 5-foot-deep shaft (obscured by larva, dead ant shells, and slime) that
opens into the ceiling of a partially collapsed, 8-foot-wide, manmade tunnel.
Following the tunnel northeast for about 70 feet leads to area 6B-1.
