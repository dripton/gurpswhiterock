Vampiric Bite (16): 2d-1 cutting Reach C. The gibbering mouther can drain the
victimâs life if the victim is helpless (pinned, stunned, unconscious, et
grappled, or willing. If he is wearing armor, the gibbering moutherâs be
damage must penetrate its DR. Once the gibbering mouther has bitten through the
victimâs DR, it can drain 1 HP per second from him. For every 3 HP sto
the gibbering mouther heals 1 HP or 1 FP (its choice). It cannot raise its HP
or FP above normal this way.
Spit Acid (16): 1d-1 corrosion. Ranged attack (Acc 3, Range 10/10), costs 1 FP.
Gibbering: As soon as a mouther spots something edible, it begins a constant
gibbering. When a creature hears this gibbering, it must roll a Fright Check
using the Confusion table (GURPS Powers, p. 85). If a victim succeeds at his
Fright Check, he will be unaffected by this ability for one hour.
Ground Manipulation: A gibbering mouther can cause stone and earth in a 4-yard
radius around it to become a morass akin to quicksand. This requires a
Concentrate maneuver and costs 1 FP. Mired creatures are grappled with ST 12.
Their only way to free themselves is to break free with a successful Quick
Contests of ST. Softening stone requires two consecutive Concentrate maneuvers.
This effect persists for 10 seconds.
