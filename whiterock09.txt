Attribute Modifiers: ST -4 [-40]; DX +1 [20]; IQ -1 [-20]; HT +2 [20].
Secondary Characteristic Modifiers: SM -2; Per +2 [10]; Basic Speed +0.25 [5];
   Basic Move -2 [-10].
Advantages: Claws (Sharp) [5]; Damage Resistance 1 (Tough Skin, -40%) [3];
   Nictitating Membrane 1 [1]; Peripheral Vision [15]; Teeth (Sharp) [1];
   Wily Little Bugger 2* [10].
Disadvantages: Cowardice (12) [-10]; Social Stigma (Savage) [-10].
Features: Born Biter

Wily Little Bugger: You know how to survive under the toughest circumstances,
especially underground. This Talent aids Prospecting, Scrounging, Survival
(Underground), and Traps. Only kobolds can have it, and may buy up to two more
levels at character creation. Reaction bonus: Miners and survivalists. 5
points/level.

Born Biter: You have an elongated jaw optimized for trapping prey. You can opt
to hold on after you bite; thus, the bite doubles as a grapple. On later turns,
you can worry, which counts as an attack but always hits - simply roll biting
damage! If your victim's SM is three or more greater than yours, you can only
do this to an extremity (hand, foot, etc.), and the grapple is considered
one-handed. If his SM is only one or two larger, you can target anything, and
the grapple is treated as two-handed. The same is true if his SM is equal to or
smaller than yours, but you can also attempt to pin him while standing! The
catch is that foes get +3 to target your protruding snout, allowing them to
attack your face (not skull) at only -2.
